Pricing generator for CPC.

***

This service was and still is currently in use at time of writing (29.09.23). It is used to generate and control
geo prices for CPC's ERP system. Staff at childsplay are given an original file containing GBP price data; the file has
to contain the code of the item / items to be added / updated / discounted but from there the application can handle most to
all caveats for generating an appropriate export file when given the initial file and the correct settings.

***

The executable in the 'dist' file runs a development version of the code. Features relating to API usage have been disabled due to security (The keys and URLs are REDACTED).
Ensure the config.json file is in the same folder as the .exe file when running.
